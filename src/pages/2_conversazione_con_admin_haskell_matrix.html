        <p>
            Thank you! Basically, it is about my GHCup configuration. 
            Because of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ucmo1t/ann_haskell_language_server_1700/">
                this bug
            </a>
            I am unable to use GHC 9.0.2. 
            <br>
            In fact, I have installed with GHCup the recommended version (which is 8.10.7), but Stack still seems to use the other one, messing with HLS, which crashes. 
            <br>
            I have tried using <span class="code">system-ghc: true</span>,
            and also tried to follow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55878447/how-to-i-change-the-default-ghc-compiler-version-on-stack">
                this thread on StackOverflow 
            </a> 
            , but that doesn't seem to help in any way. 
            <br>
            When I declare the Gloss dependency (the one that I am working with), stack enters in a sort of "dependecy hell".   
            <br>
            I have also tried to change the resolver in the stack.yaml, but that doesn't seem to help. It issues the same "dependency hell".
            If it helps, I'll leave down below the error message.
            <br>
            I have tried working on this error for a lot of time, but I haven't figured out any solution to this problem. 
            Trying to help and fix this bug would be awesome, but I don't have the knowledge required in order to do so, so I am asking an help to you.
            <br>
            Anyways, the "dependency hell" of which I'm talking about, is something similar to this one:

âžœ  amaranth stack build

Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were
encountered:

In the dependencies for amaranth-0.1.0.0:
    gloss must match >=1.13.2.2, but the stack configuration has no specified
            version  (latest matching version is 1.13.2.2)
needed since amaranth is a build target.

Some different approaches to resolving this:

    * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps
    in /home/francesco/Programmazione/Haskell/amaranth/stack.yaml:

- gloss-1.13.2.2@sha256:cdb17d6c2f7cc32dc0893e60d6c047f12ad...

            is amaranth a public project you can share a link for ? if not you may want to paste the stack.yaml and package.yaml/cabal file

        that's ok. You should change your resolver to an lts (or nightly) snapshot, not ghc
    </p>
    <p>
        eg if you need ghc 8.10.7, look for the latest snapshot for that ghc version on stackage.org, and specify that as resolver:. Don't specify compiler:
    </p>
    <div class="codeb">
resolver: lts-18.28

        Okay, thank you. If i hit stack build, it issues the same output, but with a new "suggestion".

        I compiled and seems to be working! Thank you @sm
        for your help.
        There is another issue now, but I don't know what is its cause. 
        Basically, HLS notices an error in my Setup.hs file, saying
    </p>
    <div class="codeb">

pwd: /home/francesco/Programmazione/Haskell/amaranth

("./app/Main.hs",Stack {component = Just "amaranth:exe:amaranth-exe", stackYaml = Nothing})

        with my <b>Setup.hs</b> being

        OK, finally I managed to make it work. For anyone interested in this:

            This</a> was the thread I read in order to make the whole thing work.
        <br>
    I added

- Cabal >= 3.2.1.0

     to my package.yaml dependencies.
